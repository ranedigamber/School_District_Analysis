# School_District_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis

The goal of this project was to assist Maria who is a chief data scientist for a school district analyze school funding and standardized test score. We had previously help Maria generate a concise summary of these analysis to be presented to the school district board and superintendents. Based on this analysis the school board later informed Maria that they discovered evidence of academic dishonesty. It appears that the ninth grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School have been tampered. We and Maria have been asssigned to null void all the ninth grade math and reading score from the affected school, while keeping the scores from others intact. As before we are to provide a summary as to how these changes affect the overall analysis

  Based on our primary task the election commission had further requested additional data for;
  1. Voter turnout in each county.
  2. Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count. 
  3. The county with the highest turnout.
The output of this analysis will be included in a text file that should be easy to read for audience of any background.

  * The removal of the 9th graders from the analysis yielded a new summary that has very minor changes in the "average math" and the "% math, %reading and % overall passing" scores. The figure below depicts the new district summary.
